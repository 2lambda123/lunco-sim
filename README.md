# LunCo – Lunar Colony sim

## What it is

LunCo – **Lunar Colony** *digital twin* inspired by Factorio, SimCity, Kerbal Space Program and others. 

It's a *game* and a *scientific tool*.

1. Precise enough to plan real mission
2. Training as space engineer
3. Economics

## Gameplay

Collect resources, build factories, manufacture robots and to build sustaiable lunar base.

You are playing as a CEO&Founder of a NewSpace Lunar exploration company in the nearest future. 

You want to make the Moon forpost of human civilization in space in order to colonize the whole Solar system.

## What to expect

1. Supply chain management as in Factorio
2. Robot&rocket control as in KSP
3. City management as in SimCity
4. Economics
5. Realistic technologies, physics and enviroment. E.g. you have to extract ~30-50 of different raw resources to build a satellite like Aluminum, Copper.

## Plans

1. Simulate landing of Starship on the Moon using Godot engine

## How to run

The game is at it's early stage and there are no binary builds yet. 

However you can run the game using Godot:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install [Godot 3.4.4](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4.4/) for your platform
3. Run project by clocking on "project.godot" in "game" folder

## SW Stack

1. Godot game enginer 3.4.4
2. Blender
3. GIMP
4. Inkscape
5. Visual Code


### Professional simulation SW

1. GMAT – gravitation simulation
2. Thermal transfer - TBD
3. Physics – TBD and check Godot physics and Bullet quality
