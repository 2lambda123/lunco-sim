# LunCo – Lunar Colony sim

## What it is
LunCo – **Lunar Colony** *digital twin* inspired by 

* Games: Factorio, SimCity, Kerbal Space Program and others. 
* Professional tools: [Analytic Graphics Inc](agi.com), Solidworks, Fusion 360, Thermal Desktop, GMAT, Gazebo

It's a *game* and a *scientific tool* for **full cycle** *extraterrestrial* mission analysis, planning and running. 

It's free and opensource even for **commercial use**.

### Design you own mission ###

1. Database of materials (based on db like MAPTIS)
2. Database of component
3. Follow engineering procedures: PDR, CDR, Testing, Integration, Flight, Mission Operation
4. From first unmanned missions to sustainable human colony on the Moon
5. Keep track of your budgets: money, mass, power, data.
6. Thermal, power, communications management
7. Presize interface control description: physical, mechanical, power, data, logical, thermal

## Gameplay
Collect resources, build factories, manufacture robots and to build sustaiable lunar base.

You are playing as a CEO&Founder of a NewSpace Lunar exploration company in the nearest future. 

You want to make the Moon forpost of human civilization in space in order to colonize the whole Solar system.

## What to expect
1. Supply chain management as in Factorio
2. Robot&rocket control as in KSP
3. City management as in SimCity
4. Economics
5. Realistic technologies, physics and enviroment. E.g. you have to extract ~30-50 of different raw resources to build a satellite like Aluminum, Copper.

## How to run
The game is at it's early stage and there are no binary builds yet. 

However you can run the game using Godot:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install [Godot 3.4.4](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.4.4/) for your platform
3. Run project by clocking on "project.godot" in "game" folder

## SW Stack
1. Godot game enginer 3.4.4
2. Blender
3. GIMP
4. Inkscape
5. Visual Code
